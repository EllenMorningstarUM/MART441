#HW 8 or 9, however that works: Ellen Kearns

Honestly this week I had no time to do this class. Spent every waking minute writing a 25 page research paper the last few weeks and I honestly don't have much interest in coding or programming. I'm extremely burnt out and I actually considered not doing this assignment at all, but I have yet to see a grade in this class so I don't even know if I'm passing it! So really my work this week is just copy and pasting it from other programmers githubs.

I've really struggled with learning with UM online classes. When I started to complete by degree in 2016 I was expecting to learn from teachers, not from youtube and copy and pasted websites who teach this stuff. Some of us learn better by learning from actual teachers and some of us only need youtube I guess! I prefer to learn from my instructor!
