# HW-5 Readme for Ellen Kearns

This week contained a lot of information, I was able to complete these questions with the help of my sister-in-law over the weekend. She helped me understand Object basics. I was terribly confused by how these functions worked, but I was able to work it out!

Still not enjoying the whole math aspect of javascript, but I'm slowly starting to get a handle on it.

Sorry this readme is a bit short, I have to fly across the country on Wednesday to go film a wedding, so I'm trying to get all of 4 classes done in 2.5 days! Yay for adulting!
