                <h1>About Ellen</h1>
                <p>Hello! Thank you for visiting my website, I'm Ellen Morningstar (Kearns is still my name at UM, I recently got married) I live a life on the road with my best friend and my biggest supporter, my loving husband. I started Ugly Horse Art when I first moved to Montana and I was “gifted” a rescue horse named Ugly from my amazing mother-in-law. He is my inspiration behind my business. From a skinny malnourished horse, to a handsome and sturdy steed, he is why I took the plunge and started this business, because no matter how tall the mountain is, the peak is never out of reach! If he could make it, I could make it too!</p>
                <p>I’m not a Montana native, I grew up in a very small farming community in Southern Illinois. However, when the time came to leave the nest, my sense of adventure was in full throttle, so I left my home state and the rest is history. My husband and I travel the country for his job, but Montana is our home. Spending part time in Montana and part time wherever my husband is, I have a deep-rooted passion in culture, diversity, and most of all an ever-loving sense of adventure. <p>
                <p>I’ve eaten lobster rolls on the ocean in Plymouth, Massachusetts. I’ve had the best BBQ while watching a Texas sunset, I’ve endured the coldest of winters in North Dakota, and have felt the harsh desert winds blow through the canyons of New Mexico. Most importantly, I’ve fallen in love with Northwestern Montana. It’s hard to argue waking up to snow capped mountains.  From North, South, to East and West, there’s still no place like Montana.</p>
