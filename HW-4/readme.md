# HW-4 Readme for YOUR_NAME

This week was way more informationt than I've ever had know to complete an assignment in all of my college years. Quite frankly, it makes me appreciate the fact I do not wish to become a developer or programmer. I do have a sister-in-law in this industry who's been helping me figure out some of my homework in her free time. Beyond that, I'm completely lost! Without her help, I don't believe I would get these problems figured out.

Javascript is most definitely not an easy language to learn online, props to those in this class who are understanding it!
