# HW-3 Readme for Ellen Kearns

Please place your response to this week here.


Well this week was a challenge, mainly because I'm horrible at math! No, seriously, I'm terrible at math!

The readings this week for me were more confusing than helpful for this assignment. I'm more of a learner who likes to see a finished product and then disect it.
I do understand this week's project wasn't really like that, although, I feel as if we had different sample solutions that weren't on our assignment, this would have been
less stressful.

I was able to create the program solutions, but not without great difficulty. The hardest for me was getting my looping to work and rembering the boolean properties. Luckily I have two computers so one screen was information and the other I code on.

The numbers divisible really caught me up (as aforementioned, I'm terrible at math). Upon further research I was able to realize I could get the divisible numbers using the %  and && symbols. So I didnt have to actually know what all the numbers were, just create the program to do this math for me!

I don't believe I ever had a "Ah-Ha!" moment this week, as this is all a lot to take in and try to understand.

I give props to those who do this for a living, I for one just need this class to get my degree! I think I'll stick to cinematography...for now :)!
