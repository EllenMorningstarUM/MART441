Hello, my name at UM is still currently Kearns, but I was recently married and my married name is Morningstar, thus the EllenMorningstarUM github profile! Just trying to knock out confusion before hand!

This was a good refresher from last semester.

The best way I learned was downloading Dr. Musick's example and seeing how his structure worked, both HTML and CSS.

From there I played with his codes and changed them around.

I did have some issues with pictures and sizing but math is not my strong suit, neither is coding, so hopefully something will click this semester.
