HW-2

Javascript sounds like a must and after viewing the code source of my own webpage that I created through squarespace, I see it everywhere; thus the smooth
functionality of my website.

This week wasn't super challenging, I like the approach of easing into learning javascript instead of just cramming everything to know about it one week.

My last coding class left a bad taste in my mouth, however, this one is giving me hope!
