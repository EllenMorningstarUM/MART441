I really struggled this week, I couldn't get my pages to work and honestly I ran out of time.
I'm sure somewhere I'm missing something, but honestly I'm so burnt out at the moment I couldn't even muster up the energy to tear it all down and restart.

I'm sure this will be a disappointing page to Dr. Musick and my classmates, but we can't be on 100% all the time, this is just one of those assignments for me.
