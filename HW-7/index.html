    <p>Cinematography is a great choice! It's becoming a very popular option for documenting important days.
      I for one am a professional cinematographer and to me this type of art creates a lasting memory. You can always go back
      and listen to the kind words that were said, the goofiness of the day and keep reliving your day.</p>

    <p>Photography is a timeless option, it's been around for centuries and most young couples today are faced with budget restraints. Which means choosing either or,
      photography or cinematography. But, there's a fun way around going bankrupt trying to document your day. Most photographers know cinematographers and most cinematographers
      will offer a pretty exceptional deal if you choose certain photographers.</p>
