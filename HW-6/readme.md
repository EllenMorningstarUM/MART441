# HW-6 Readme for Ellen Kearns

I definitely had some trouble getting stuff to become perfectly aligned this week! And the entire project wasn't difficult, just repetitive. I had to do some reasearching independently, I started running out of time and wasn't really understanding everything I was reading this week with all the links and articles.

I'm still trying to get back in the groove, I've been on the road since March 1st and finally made it back home on the 7th from a long drive from New Mexico to Montana and back! Go to school and work full time they said, it'll be fun they said! Anywho, not a bad week, I'm glad we didn't have to write functions! Ha!
